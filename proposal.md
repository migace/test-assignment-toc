# TOC Application Improvement Proposal

## **Enhanced Keyboard Navigation and Accessibility**

### **Overview**

The current TOC application provides basic mouse interaction but lacks keyboard navigation and accessibility features. This improvement will enhance the user experience for keyboard users, screen reader users, and improve overall accessibility compliance.

### **Current State Analysis**

- ✅ Mouse click navigation works
- ✅ Visual styling and animations are implemented
- ✅ Search functionality exists
- ❌ No keyboard navigation (Tab, Arrow keys, Enter, Space)
- ❌ Limited accessibility features
- ❌ No focus management
- ❌ No ARIA labels or roles

### **Proposed Enhancement**

Implement comprehensive keyboard navigation and accessibility features to make the TOC application usable for all users, including those with disabilities.

### **Technical Requirements**

#### **1. Keyboard Navigation**

- **Tab navigation**: Users can tab through all interactive elements
- **Arrow key navigation**: Navigate between TOC items at the same level
- **Enter/Space**: Expand/collapse items and activate them
- **Escape**: Close expanded sections or clear search
- **Home/End**: Jump to first/last item in current level

#### **2. Focus Management**

- **Visible focus indicators**: Clear visual focus states for all interactive elements
- **Focus trapping**: Keep focus within expanded sections
- **Focus restoration**: Return focus to appropriate element after operations
- **Skip links**: Allow users to jump to main content

#### **3. Accessibility Features**

- **ARIA labels**: Proper labeling for screen readers
- **ARIA roles**: Semantic roles for navigation, tree, and interactive elements
- **ARIA states**: Expanded/collapsed states, current selection
- **Screen reader announcements**: Dynamic content updates
- **High contrast mode**: Improved visibility for users with visual impairments

#### **4. Enhanced User Experience**

- **Keyboard shortcuts**: Quick navigation (e.g., Ctrl+F for search)
- **Search highlighting**: Visual indication of search terms in results
- **Breadcrumb navigation**: Show current location in the tree
- **Quick jump**: Type first letters to jump to items
- **Clear button**: Button to clear search input and reset results
- **Search persistence**: Remember last search query for better UX
